Hi, my name is Gang Zhao [赵罡]
=====
I'm a research scientist in IGSNRR (CAS), remote sensing specialist, hydrologist, and life explorer and learner~

My research touches on interdisciplinary water science including surface water monitoring, climate change, drought and water scarcity, global scale ecology, water quality, and deep learning.

赵罡，中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所研究员，博士生导师，入选中国科学院引才计划青年项目并获择优支持。2018年博士毕业于美国德克萨斯A&M大学，后在斯坦福卡内基科学研究所进行博后训练。主要围绕变化环境的背景，对陆地水体的“水量平衡-能量平衡-水质变化”进行系统性遥感观测和数值模拟。作为项目骨干参与研发美国国家航空航天局(NASA)官方水库数据产品算法，研究成果被白宫经济顾问委员会等引用。以第一/通讯作者在Nature Water、PNAS、Nature Communications、Geophysical Research Letters、 Remote Sensing of Environment发表SCl论文十余篇。担任Remote Sensing、Frontiers in Environmental Science客座主编。

依托陆地水循环及地表过程实验室，课题组诚招博士生和博士后，有意者请将个人简历、主要科研成果等发送邮件至邮箱gzhao@igsnrr.ac.cn。
