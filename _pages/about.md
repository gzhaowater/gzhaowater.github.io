# Hi, my name is Gang Zhao

I'm a research scientist in IGSNRR (CAS), remote sensing specialist, hydrologist, and life explorer and learner~

My research touches on interdisciplinary water science including surface water monitoring, climate change, drought and water scarcity, global scale ecology, water quality, and deep learning.
